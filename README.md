# Cross-transfer learning for figurative language explanations

## Project description
In this project, we compare sequential fine-tuning with a model for multi-task learning in the context
where we are interested in boosting performance on two tasks, one of which depends on the other. We test 
these models on the *FigLang2022* shared task which requires participants to predict language inference labels on
figurative language along with corresponding textual explanations of the inference predictions.

## Project structure

### Folder descriptions
```text
   |__ src
        |__ bias
        |    contains the code for the bias experiments in Section 6 of our paper.  
        |__ e2e
        |   contains our HiFeatMTL code.
        |__ evaluate
        |    contains our evaluation scripts. In particular it contains *eval_metrics.py*, which is the 
        |    official evaluation script of the FigLang2022 shared task.
        |__ modelling
        |    contains the code for hyperparameter tuning on dev sets.
        |__ preprocessor
        |    contains dataset loaders for eSNLI, IMPLI, the FigLang2022 dataset, and the simile dataset.
        |__ tasks
        |    contains the code that we used to train our final models and test on the official test set. 
        |    These results were submitted to the leaderboard.
   |__ submissions
   |     contains the output prediction files (.json) generated by our models, which we evaluated with the shared task 
   |     metric in *src/evaluate/eval_metrics.py.* These scores were submitted to the leaderboard.
```

### Tables from our paper

Table 2: The IMPLI model from this table was trained using *src/modelling/train_impli.py*

Table 4: Results were generated using *src/evaluate/eval_metrics.py*

Table 5: Results were generated using *src/bias/train_t5_bias.py*
